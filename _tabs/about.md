Throughout my career, I've read many different blogs to learn and consider new perspectives for many topics in software development.
Some were good, some were bad, but in the end, they helped me immensely and I hope this helps others in a similar manner.

Sure enough, AI may replace or change the role of software developers. Whether it's ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Claude, Gemini, or
whatever of the future countless tools that will come to market, there's still plenty to learn and either this will help someone 
or will end up helping AI by using this blog's content within its model.
